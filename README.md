## Configuring

To change your api key, copy it from your [Settings page](https://wakatime.com/settings#apikey), then paste into Sketch `Plugins â†’ WakaTime`.

Additional settings are in `$HOME/.wakatime.cfg` for [wakatime cli](https://github.com/wakatime/wakatime#configuring).

## Contributing

To run this plugin from a local clone of the repo:

1. `git clone git@github.com:wakatime/sketch-wakatime.git`
2. `cd sketch-wakatime`
3. `ln -s "$PWD/sketch-wakatime/WakaTime.sketchplugin" ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Plugins/WakaTime.sketchplugin`
4. `npm run watch`

To view the output from `console.log`, you have a few different options:

- Use the [`sketch-dev-tools`](https://github.com/skpm/sketch-dev-tools)
- Run `skpm log` in your Terminal, with the optional `-f` argument (`skpm log -f`) which causes `skpm log` to not stop when the end of logs is reached, but rather to wait for additional data to be appended to the input

### Publishing

```bash
skpm publish <major|minor|patch>
```

(where `bump` can be `patch`, `minor` or `major`)

`skpm publish` will create a new release on your GitHub repository and create an appcast file in order for Sketch users to be notified of the update.

## Troubleshooting

The Sketch plugin logs errors to `Console.app` and `~/.wakatime/wakatime.log`.

For more info on debugging Sketch plugins see the [official docs](https://developer.sketch.com/plugins/debugging).
